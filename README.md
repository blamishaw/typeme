### An instant-messaging chat app build using Node.js and React
<br>
I built this app with the intention of understanding certain technologies, namely:
<br>
1. The WebSocket protocol and designing a reliable messaging client-server system
<br>
2. React functional components and hooks (useContext, useEffect, etc.)
<br>
3. Dockerizing a full-stack application and deploying to Heroku
<br>

## Planned Features
- [] Update UI for mobile and add tasteful animations
- [] Implement an active users list
- [] Persistent Storage
    - [] Store message in DB for 30 min after sent
    - [] Fetch messages on client and add infinity scroll
### FAR IN FUTURE (v2)
- [] User authentication and metadata
- [] Unicast and room-based messaging among users
